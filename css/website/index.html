		<h1 id="b" >Welcome To Flowers</h1>
		<p>The rose is red, the violet’s blue,
The honey’s sweet, and so are you.
Thou are my love and I am thine;
I drew thee to my Valentine:
The lot was cast and then I drew,
And Fortune said it shou’d be you.</p>
<p>They are autographs of angels, penned
In Nature’s green-leaved book, in blended tints,
Borrowed from rainbows and the sunset skies,
And written everywhere–on plain and hill,
In lonely dells, ‘mid crowded haunts of men;
On the broad prairies, where no eye save God’s
May read their silent, sacred mysteries. Thank God for flowers!
They gladden human hearts; Seraphic breathings part their fragrant lips
With whisperings of Heaven.</p>
<p>Bright little day stars
Scattered all over the earth,
Ye drape the house of mourning
And ye deck the hall of mirth.

Ye are gathered to grace the ballroom,
Ye are borne to the house of prayer,
Ye wither upon the snowy shroud,
Ye fade in the bride’s jeweled hair.

Ye are relics of bygone ages,
From Eden inherited,
To gladden the homes of the living,
And mourn on the graves of the dead.</p>
<p>Vibrant, beautiful, and full of life.
She radiates positive energy while
she absorbs the warm rays and brightness of the sun
reflecting her image with purity, passion, and love.
When drizzled with a little rain it begins to tickle with delight
and blooms into a confident, vivacious flower.
It will stand up Tall amongst million of flowers with confidence
and humility above all.

It takes a special gardener to nurture his find, as he
knows that beauty so rare and precious will continue to
to blossom given the love, time, and affection it truly deserves.

He knows to cultivate it and treasure it so
it becomes his utmost valuable treasure.
Keeping her seeds from drifting to another garden
will forever be his challenge and commitment to
that once a delicate flower, but now a radiant and captivating woman.
God’s greatest creation!</p>
		<p>There was one of my kin (of another day)
When the Riddle of Life defied her powers,
And her fretted heart rebelled, would say,
“I will go out and look at the flowers.”

And after a while–like those who had quaffed
Of the cup that Helen distilled in her bowers,
Returned from the garden, she softly laughed–
“I have been out to look at the flowers!”

My heart is so ill with the growth of ills
The world is sheaving, these harvest hours–
The sword that smites, and the shell that kills,
While Life lies charred ‘neath the burning towers!

Nothing to do–it will be as Who wills?
Helpless to aid, how my hurt soul cowers!…
Let me drink of the cup that pure Beauty distills–
I will go out and look at the flowers!</p>
